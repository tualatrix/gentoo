	GNOME Do allows you to quickly search for many items present in your GNOME
	desktop environment (applications, Evolution contacts, Firefox bookmarks,
	files, artists and albums in Rhythmbox, Pidgin buddies, etc.) and perform
	commonly used actions on those items (Run, Open, Email, Chat, Play, etc.).
	GNOME Do is inspired by Quicksilver and GNOME Launch Box.
